## Problem Domain

Create a two (2) person, turn based Tic-Tac-Toe program. Building off of your starter code provided, complete the Tic Tac Toe logic.

A Game board, to a user, looks like this:

|1|2|3|<br>
|4|5|6|<br>
|7|8|9|<br>

The numbers in each of the squares will indicate the position number. Prompt the user to select which position they wish to play and then replace that position with either an X or an O.

A winning board may look like this (O Wins!):

|X|X|O|<br>
|4|O|X|<br>
|O|X|9|<br>
Remember that Tic-Tac-Toe is a 2 player game, so be sure to “switch” between players.

Make it known to the user that their turn is over and it’s time for the next players turn. You will both play on the same board.

## Tests

Test that your program has the following functionality:

Given a game board, test for winners
Test that there is a switch in players between turns
Test to confirm that the position the player inputs correlates to the correct index of the array
One other “unique” test of your own.
